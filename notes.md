# Notes taken while making this project 

## **Shuffling cards**
- There should be two instances of every card image
- and these instances should be in random order in a shuffled card stack
- to shuffle card we use spread cardImages array twice 
- and sort theme in random order 
- and given them an random id

## **Flipping**
- First back should be visible
- When a card is selected then its front should be visible

## **Disabling Cards**
- when cards one and teo are selected all card should be disable for a while
